# Project Name : RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DRUG DOSAGE AND PULSE RATE OF PATIENTS USING MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSIONS
# Made By - Priyansh Sharma

* In the department of Health care , there are different research take place and we tested many samples
of a particular medicine on many people of different ages wih different dosages and check their effect
and ultimately go with a particular sample that comes out to be most affective on a patient’s health .
Thus the problem statement is to – Predict the Change in the pulse rate of a person of a given age and
is given a particular dosage of the entire 3 sample given. The given age and dosage has already been
collected as a CSV (Comma-seperated Values) file

# Problem statement :
* Given a dataset which consists of people of different ages are dosed with 3 samples of a medicine of
different dosage and are tested on there change in pulse rate from normal pulse rate being 80 beats per
minute.
* We will be predicting which sample is good for a person of particular age and is given a particular
dosage so that there is not much effect on pulse rate using Multiple linear regression method.

# Dataset Description :
* Name: Name of Patient
* Age (in years): Age of Patient
* Dosage (in %): Dosage of Sample medicine given
* Change in Pulse rate (beats / minute) due to sample 1: Deviation from normal pulse rate
* Change in Pulse rate (beats / minute) due to sample 2: Deviation from normal pulse rate
* Change in Pulse rate (beats / minute) due to sample 3: Deviation from normal pulse rate

# Tools and Library Used :
* **Language used** : Python 3
* **Platform** : Jupyter Notebook
* **Dataset used** : pulserate.csv
* **Library used** : Numpy, pandas,matplotlib
* **Algorithm used** : Multiple Linear Regression with 2 Variable
